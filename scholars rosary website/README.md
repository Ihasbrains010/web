# Scholars Rosary School Website Frontend

This project contains the frontend code for the Scholars Rosary school website.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website structure.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for interactive features.
- `logo.png`: The school's logo.

## How to View

1.  Ensure all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `logo.png`) are in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.

## Next Steps / Enhancements

-   Replace the placeholder hero image in `style.css` (in the `.hero-section` background URL) with a relevant, high-quality image.
-   Add detailed content to each section in `index.html`.
-   Implement the mobile menu toggle by adding a hamburger icon/button to `index.html` and uncommenting/refining the relevant JavaScript in `script.js` and CSS in `style.css`.
-   Further enhance the UI/UX with more sophisticated design elements, animations, or interactive components based on requirements.
